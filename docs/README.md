### Use the REST/API

Run a web request to: [https://www.castellanidavide.it/other/rest/product/create_priority.php](https://www.castellanidavide.it/other/rest/product/create_priority.php)
It needs this json as POST argument:
```
{
  "token": "<Your_GitHub_token>",
  "username": "<Your_GitHub_username>",
  "answers": {
    "name": "<The_new_repo_name>",
    "template": "<The_template_to_use(eg. default or Owner/repo-template)>", # Remember that if you use your own template, the repo must to be private
    "descr": "<Short_description>",
    "prefix": "<The_prefix_of_the_repo>", # If you are not interested to use a prefix, leave this string empty ""
    "private": <If_the_repo_is_private(true/false)>,
    "isOrg": <If_you_want_your_repo_in_an_organization(true/false)>,
    "org": "<Name_of_the_org>", # This is necessary only if "isOrg" = true
    "team": "<The_name_of_the_team>"
  }
}
```

### Use the Android app
[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.castellanidavide.createstructure.createstructure)


In the future there will be other methods to create the repository.

## How to create your own template
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/5213/5523800294_80f0687af7_b.jpg)

### 1. Use template option
![](https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/accounting-and-taxes/48/easy_to_use_accessible_press_button_gesture_effortless-512.png)
  - Use createstructure to create the project that will become the new template

### 2. Personalize it
![](https://www.emotivebrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Get-a-Leg-Up-With-Our-New-Web-Content-Personalization-eBook.png)
  - You can clone on your PC and choose what and how to change (it's not a problem if you want to change all the structure :smile:)
  - Take attention to che .castellanidavide\change.json file
    - The this file is a Json one, so => {..., "from": "to", ...}
    - Make attention to this special alias
      - sol<...>sol: see the complete list [here](https://github.com/createstructure/core-createstructure/blob/main/bin/libraries/createstructure_changes.hpp#L69-L101)
      - to do not change the a word repeate two times "sol": eg. solnamesol => solsolnamesolsol
      - (Do you have any idea for new alias? You can say me on the help email help@castellanidavide.it and I could add it to newer versions)
  - Remember to push your changes

### 3. Try it
![](https://assuredstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TRY.jpg)
